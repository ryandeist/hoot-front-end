# Hoot Front-End - Update a Hoot

## Overview
In this lesson, weâ€™ll implement the following user story:

> As the author of a hoot, I should see a link to â€˜Editâ€™ a hoot on the â€˜Detailsâ€™ page. Clicking on the link should direct me to an â€˜Editâ€™ page where I can modify the hoot. Upon submitting the update, I should be redirected back to the â€˜Detailsâ€™ page.

This functionality will **not require a new component**, as we will refactor the existing `HootForm` component to handle both **create** and **update**.

To accomplish this, weâ€™ll use the `useParams()` hook. The `useParams()` hook allows us to read data held in the URL, and based on that data, weâ€™ll augment the content and functionality of our component.

## Build the UI
Before we modify our form, weâ€™ll add the â€˜Editâ€™ `<Link>` that directs a user to that page.

1. Add `Link` to the existing `react-router` import in the `HootDetails` component:

    ```jsx
    // src/components/HootDetails/HootDetails.jsx

    import { useParams, Link } from 'react-router';
    ```

2. Next, add the edit `<Link>` directly above the **Delete** `<button>`:

    ```jsx
    // src/components/HootDetails/HootDetails.jsx

            <header>
            <p>{hoot.category.toUpperCase()}</p>
            <h1>{hoot.title}</h1>
            <p>
                {`${hoot.author.username} posted on
                ${new Date(hoot.createdAt).toLocaleDateString()}`}
            </p>
            {hoot.author._id === user._id && (
                <>
                {/* Add a new Link */}
                <Link to={`/hoots/${hootId}/edit`}>Edit</Link>

                <button onClick={() => props.handleDeleteHoot(hootId)}>
                    Delete
                </button>
                </>
            )}
            </header>
    ```
    Take note of the value given `to` the to prop; it will be important in the following steps:

    ```jsx
    `/hoots/${hootId}/edit`;
    ```

3. Add a new **protected** route in the `App` component:

    ```jsx
    // src/App.jsx

            <>
                {/* Protected Routes (available only to signed-in users) */}
                <Route path='/hoots' element={<HootList hoots={hoots}/>} />
                <Route 
                path='/hoots/:hootId'
                element={<HootDetails handleDeleteHoot={handleDeleteHoot}/>}
                />
                <Route 
                path='/hoots/new' 
                element={<HootForm handleAddHoot={handleAddHoot} />}
                />
                {/* Add this route! */}
                <Route
                path='/hoots/:hootId/edit'
                element={<HootForm />}
                />
            </>
    ```

In the next section, weâ€™ll access the value of this `hootId` parameter with the `useParams()` hook.

## Modify the `HootForm`
1. Head to the `HootForm` component and import `useParams` from `react-router`:

    ```jsx
    // src/components/HootForm/HootForm.jsx

    import { useParams } from 'react-router';
    ```

2. Within the component, call `useParams()` to access the `hootId`:

    ```jsx
    // src/components/HootForm/HootForm.jsx

    const HootForm = (props) => {
    // Destructure hootId from the useParams hook, and console log it
    const { hootId } = useParams();
    console.log(hootId);
    const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
        title: '',
        text: '',
        category: 'News',
    });

    // handleChange, handleSubmit, and return statement code here
    };
    ```
    > ðŸ’¡ Test this now! Your console log should show that `hootId` is undefined when you navigate to the form using the `NEW HOOT` link. However, `hootId` will have a value when you navigate to the form using the **Edit** link on the `HootDetails` page.

3. We can also confirm this visually by adding an `<h1>` and a ternary to our JSX to change the heading based on the presence of a `hootId`:

    ```jsx
    // src/components/HootForm/HootForm.jsx

    return (
        <main>
        {/* Add a heading */}
        <h1>{hootId ? 'Edit Hoot' : 'New Hoot'}</h1>
        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
            {/* Form labels and inputs */}
        </form>
        </main>
    );
    ```

Now, if you navigate between the â€˜Editâ€™ and â€˜Newâ€™ pages, you should notice the pageâ€™s title change, even though weâ€™re using the same component for both actions.

This example demonstrates how we can modify other elements and behaviors of the component.

- If a `hootId` is present, we can assume the user has accessed the â€˜Editâ€™ page, which requires update functionality.
- Otherwise, React should render the basic â€˜Newâ€™ form and use the existing code to create a hoot.

## Set `formData` state
The first modification weâ€™ll make to the componentâ€™s functionality relates to its initial state. If the user is updating a hoot, we should prefill the inputs of our form with any existing hoot details. This will require calling the `hootService.show()` service within the `HootForm` component.

1. At the top of the `HootForm` component, add imports for `hootService` and `useEffect`:

    ```jsx
    // src/components/HootForm/HootForm.jsx

    // Add useEffect to the existing import statement for react
    import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
    import { useParams } from 'react-router';

    // Import the hootService's exports
    import * as hootService from '../../services/hootService';
    ```

2. Add the following useEffect()

    ```jsx
    // src/components/HootForm/HootForm.jsx

    useEffect(() => {
        const fetchHoot = async () => {
        const hootData = await hootService.show(hootId);
        setFormData(hootData);
        };
        if (hootId) fetchHoot();
    }, [hootId]);
    ```
    > ðŸ’¡ Notice the `if` condition and the inclusion of `hootId` in the dependency array. If a `hootId` is present, we make a request to our server and use the `hootData` response to set the `formData` state. If there is no `hootId`, we leave the initial state of `formData` unchanged.

3. Take a moment to confirm that the initial state of `formData` is correctly set when editing a hoot.

4. You may have noticed a bug if you happened to click on the **NEW HOOT** link in the nav bar while editing a hoot. The heading changes as it should, but the form fields still have the details of the hoot you were editing. To fix this issue, we need to add a cleanup function to our `useEffect()`:

    ```jsx
    // src/components/HootForm/HootForm.jsx

    useEffect(() => {
        const fetchHoot = async () => {
        const hootData = await hootService.show(hootId);
        setFormData(hootData);
        };
        if (hootId) fetchHoot();

        // Add a cleanup function
        return () => setFormData({ title: '', text: '', category: 'News' });
    }, [hootId]);
    ```
    > ðŸ’¡ A cleanup function is a function that is returned from the `useEffect()` hook. The job of a cleanup function is to undo whatever the effect did.

    > React will call the cleanup function when a component is removed from the DOM or immediately before the `useEffect()` is re-run (like when something in the dependency array changes).

    > In this case, the cleanup function helps us by resetting the `formData` state when the `hootId` changes from having a value (when weâ€™re editing an existing hoot) to not having a value (when we create a new hoot).

## Build the `handleUpdateHoot()` function
1. Next, weâ€™ll add the `handleUpdateHoot()` function in the `App` component:

    ```jsx
    // src/App.jsx

    const handleUpdateHoot = async (hootId, hootFormData) => {
        console.log('hootId:', hootId, 'hootFormData:', hootFormData);
        navigate(`/hoots/${hootId}`);
    };
    ```
    For now, weâ€™ll confirm that the function is receiving two pieces of data:

    - `hootId`
    - `hootFormData`

2. Next, pass the function down to the `<HootForm>`:

    ```jsx
    // src/App.jsx

            <>
                {/* Protected Routes (available only to signed-in users) */}
                <Route path='/hoots' element={<HootList hoots={hoots}/>} />
                <Route 
                path='/hoots/:hootId'
                element={<HootDetails handleDeleteHoot={handleDeleteHoot}/>}
                />
                <Route 
                path='/hoots/new' 
                element={<HootForm handleAddHoot={handleAddHoot} />}
                />
                {/* Pass the new handleUpdateHoot function */}
                <Route
                path='/hoots/:hootId/edit'
                element={<HootForm handleUpdateHoot={handleUpdateHoot}/>}
                />
            </>
    ```
    > ðŸš¨ There are currently two routes rendering the `<HootForm>` in `src/App.jsx`. Be sure to pass `handleUpdateHoot` to the component being rendered for the `/hoots/:hootId/edit` route!

3. Back in the `HootForm` component, update the existing `handleSubmit()` function to use this new function when weâ€™re updating an existing hoot:

    ```jsx
    // src/components/HootForm/HootForm.jsx

    const handleSubmit = (evt) => {
    evt.preventDefault();
    if (hootId) {
        props.handleUpdateHoot(hootId, formData);
    } else {
        props.handleAddHoot(formData);
    }
    };
    ```
    > ðŸ’¡ Once again, we are relying on the `hootId` to determine the behavior of our component. If a `hootId` is present, we call `props.handleUpdateHoot(hootId, formData)`. Otherwise, we call `props.handleAddHoot(formData)`

4. Submit the `edit` form and confirm that the necessary data is being passed up the component tree. On submit, you should see a `console.log()` originating from `App.jsx`.

## Build the service function
The following code is similar to what youâ€™ve seen in previous parts of the lesson. However, our `update()` service function will differ slightly from the `create()` service function. It uses a `PUT` request and takes two parameters:

- The first parameter is `hootId`, which is used to identify the hoot to update.
- The second parameter contains the updated `hootFormData` for the hoot.

With all of this in mind, letâ€™s write the `update()` service function:

```jsx
// src/services/hootService.js

async function update(hootId, hootFormData) {
  try {
    const res = await fetch(`${BASE_URL}/${hootId}`, {
      method: 'PUT',
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem('token')}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(hootFormData),
    });
    return res.json();
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}

export {
  index,
  show,
  create,
  createComment,
  deleteHoot,
  // As always, remember to export:
  update,
};
```

## Call the service
Next, weâ€™ll update the handleUpdateHoot() function in the App component with our service and set state accordingly.

```jsx
// src/App.jsx

const handleUpdateHoot = async (hootId, hootFormData) => {
  const updatedHoot = await hootService.update(hootId, hootFormData);
  setHoots(hoots.map((hoot) => (hootId === hoot._id ? updatedHoot : hoot)));
  navigate(`/hoots/${hootId}`);
};
```
> ðŸ’¡ This implementation of the map() method is a bit different from the mapping of JSX elements youâ€™ve seen in React previously.

We use `map()` here to update a specific `hoot` in the `hoots` state array. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what is happening:

- `hootService.update()` returns the `updatedHoot` after sending the update request to the back-end.
- We use `map()` to iterate over the `hoots` array and check each `hoot` object.
    - If the `_id` of the current `hoot` matches the `hootId`, we replace it with the `updatedHoot`.
    - If the `_id` of the current `hoot` doesnâ€™t match, we return the original `hoot` object.

Through this process, we can update a single object held in hoots state while maintaining an accurate record of the remaining elements in the array.

> ðŸ§  If you are curious as to why something like the `splice()` method is not applicable here, check out React documentation on [updating arrays without mutation](https://react.dev/learn/updating-arrays-in-state#updating-arrays-without-mutation).

Try it out! After updating a hoot, you should be directed to the list page with the modified hoot information.
